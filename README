I have an OrangePi RV2 with a RISC-V Ky X1 processor (I believe it's a rebranded SpacemiT K1).
This architecture doesn't have a lot of application images, so I'll be building them myself.

Wishlist:

- [ ] ArchiveBox
- [ ] Navidrome
- [ ] slskd
- [ ] Syncthing
- [ ] Transmission
- [ ] Xandikos
- [ ] Immich
- [ ] Jellyfin (probably not possible for now)
